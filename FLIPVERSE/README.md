# 📔 **FLIPVERSE**
### *Because even notes deserve a little magic.*

A creative notepad that transforms plain text into a **flipbook-style notebook.**  
The goal: to make writing feel warm, visual, and personal.

Planned Features:
- 📝 Write and save notes easily
- 📖 View them in a digital flipbook animation
- 🌈 Pastel UI inspired by real notebooks
- ✨ Option to add headers, tags, or small icons

> *Planned for Month 3 — a Python-based UI/UX mini project.*
