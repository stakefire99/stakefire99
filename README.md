# 🌸 Welcome to **STAKEFIRE99**
### *my calm corner of code, data & creative logic.*

Hi there 👋  
I’m **Lakshita** — an MCA student specializing in **Data Analytics**, currently exploring how logic meets emotion through **data, design, and storytelling**.  

This page is my little workspace of curiosity where I learn, build, and reflect.  
From decoding numbers to creating tools that make life easier, I’m building a portfolio that blends creativity with tech ✨
